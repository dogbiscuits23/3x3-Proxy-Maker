## FFG Print and Play PDF Card Images

Fantasy Flight Games include print and play files on their website which are in PDF format (for example, the Ronan Modular set for Marvel Champions or Arkham Horror scenarios).

If you want to use this program to print them, select Import PDF Pages instead of selecting a folder. The pages will be extracted and converted to PNG images. You can then continue with the steps above as normal.

## Notes

- Images are resized using high-quality resampling to improve clarity when printed at the target size.
- The contrast option helps to compensate for the loss of definition and contrast that can occur when printing on matte or lower-quality paper.
- 600 DPI may upscale your images if they are smaller than the target size.
- Always print at 100% scaling.
- For best results, print on high-quality paper and use card sleeves.

## Card sizes

- **61 × 88 mm** — Android: Netrunner, Legend of the Five Rings, later sets of Warhammer: Invasion, Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, Marvel Champions, Arkham Horror LCG
